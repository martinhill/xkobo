# XKOBO for the Web

Xkobo is a simple open-source game developed by Akira Higuchi, in 1997. It was originally for X Window system. Looking for a fun project to learn HTML5/javascript, I decided to make a port for the web. I'm compiling the C++ code to javascript with emscripten and refactoring the X11 parts to use my own library. It's a learning process for me, and hopefully others will like to play this classic game on the web. Enjoy!
